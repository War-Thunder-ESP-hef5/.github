## 💡 What Is War Thunder ESP?

ESP is a visual hack that overlays enemy info on your screen, even through walls, smokes, terrain, and buildings. It tracks:

* Player names & vehicle types
* Health, crew positions, ammo status
* Weak points like engines and ammo racks
* Direction, distance, and movement
* Optional outlines, boxes, tracers, and glow

No more guesswork — just pure intel.
